==================================================
(1) INTRODUCTION, DIRS STRUCTURE, RUN INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================
 
Hi There,

This README contains instructions on the basic steps to get you going with the analog code.

First, the directory structure:

- "code": here you find the source code, executable, and makefile;
- "input": it contains input data and necessary input files (analog_ini.txt and weight_ini.txt);
- "output": it contains the output generated by the analog code (ascii or netcdf);
- "lib": libraries configuration code;
- "setup": scripts to set things up;
- "verification_scripts": scripts to generate verification diagrams as rank histogram, 
  reliability and sharpness, dispersion, ROC skill score, Brier skill score, and binned 
  spread/skill plot (see README_ver.scripts.txt for info on how to run the scripts).  

OK then, to run the code for your project you should: 
- Create directories with the project name under "input" and "output"; 
- Add to input/"PROJECT NAME" the input data (an input namelist called analog_input.nml, and 
  either one file for the predictions and one for the observations, or a single file containing both); 
  for format (netcdf) examples have a look at the file input/xcel/combined_data.20140425.12z.nc.
  NOTE: in the input necdf a "missing_value" (or a "_FillValue") attribute needs to be defined, common to 
  each variable (for predictions and observations, otherwise the code will quit!); this value will be 
  used also in the output file;
- In the so-called "ATEC" file format (see namelist below), the dimensional variables (C-format order)
  and names are as follows

  variable(gen_date, lead_time, site) 
   * gen_date: YYYYMMDD
   * lead_time: forecast lead time in hours, e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc
   * site: name of site, e.g., crtc_s01, crtc_s04, etc

  example of the "ATEC" file format can be found in input/atec4_oper/veri.150602.000000.cdf 
- In the so-called "non-ATEC" file format (see namelist below), the dimensional variables (C-format order)
  and names are as follows

  variable(Days, Lead\ times, Staz)
   * Days: day of forecast, e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc, no link to calendar YYYYMMDD
   * Lead\ times: forecast lead time (could be hours or minutes)
   * Staz: station number, e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc

  example of the "non-ATEC" file format can be found in input/crtc2/crtc.verif.20141031.2sta.cdf

- Add to input/"PROJECT NAME" an input namelist called analog_input.nml (you can use copies from existing 
  projects as existing template). 
- Make the necessary changes to analog_input.nml to set input and output file names, parameters related 
  to the variable to be predicted, the analog predictors, and the analog code (see below explanation of 
  each entry of analog_input.nml);
- Add to input/"PROJECT NAME" an input file containing the weights of the analog predictors called 
  weight_ini.txt (you can use copies from existing projects as existing template; basic configuration 
  is with all weights set to 1).  
- Go to the directory "code"; 
- Link the files analog_input.nml and weight_ini.txt to their copies in input/"PROJECT NAME";
- Compile the code (see intsructions below for Yellowstone);
- Run "./main_analog";
- The output of you run is under /output/"PROJECT NAME";
- Run the scripts under "verification_scripts" to assess the performance of the analog code.

Have fun!


==================================================
(2) COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================== 

- scripts to compile (modify the paths/environments for your
  machine)

     * compile_gnu_seq.csh :  gfortran sequential compile
     * compile_gnu_par.csh :  gfortran parallel compile
     * compile_ifort_seq.csh: ifort sequential compile
     * compile_ifort_par.csh: ifort parallel compile

  Details in how to set the compilation environment are
  explained below.

-----------------------------------------------
COMPILATION STEPS ON YELLOWSTONE: ifort and MPI
-----------------------------------------------
1) Suggested shell: "tcsh"

2) Load in the environment the modules:
module load intel/16.0.0

To correctly load these modules it could be necessary to unload the hdf5 module, 
by typing these commands:

module load intel/16.0.0
module unload hdf5

3) setenv NETCDF_ROOT /glade/apps/opt/netcdf/4.3.3.1/intel/16.0.0

4) setenv CODE $PATH/anen

5) setenv MPI_TOP /glade/u/home/chengw/intel/mpich2

   here you have to create your own mpich2 environment by linking the paths

   in /glade/u/home/chengw/intel/mpich2

      include -> /opt/ibmhpc/pe1307/mpich2/intel/include64
      lib -> /opt/ibmhpc/pe1307/mpich2/intel/lib64
      bin/mpif90 -> /glade/apps/opt/modulefiles/ys/cmpwrappers/mpif90

6) configure FC=ifort MPI=$MPI_TOP NETCDF_ROOT=$NETCDF_ROOT --enable-mpi --prefix=$CODE
   make

7) executable main_analog is under directory code


--------------------------------------------
COMPILATION STEPS ON YELLOWSTONE: ifort only
--------------------------------------------

Everything is the same as ifort and MPI except

   configure FC=ifort NETCDF_ROOT=$NETCDF_ROOT --prefix=$CODE
   make


-----------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION STEPS ON LINUX CLUSTER: ifort and OpenMPI
-----------------------------------------------------

Right now, the code works with Intel Fortran and OpenMPI. The code
is designed to work in parallel. You must compile with OpenMPI. The configuring
and compiling can be done in "compile_ifort_par.csh" in directory "anen".

1) set paths for the following:

 a) INTEL_PATH
    - top level of Intel compiler, just above bin, e.g.,
      /opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.3.174

 b) CODE
    - top directory level of code, e.g.,
      $PATH/anen

 c) NETCDF_ROOT
    - top directory level of Netcdf (intel), e.g.,
      /opt/netcdf-20130827-intel14.0.3

 d) HDF
    - top directory level of HDF, e.g.,
      /opt/hdf5-1.8.9-intel14.0.3

 e) NCARG_ROOT_intel
    - top directory level of NCAR graphics (NCL) for intel, e.g.,
      /opt/ncl_ncarg-6.2.0-intel14.0.3

 f) MPI
    - top directory level of OpenMPI (intel), e.g.,
      /opt/openmpi-1.8.1-intel14.0.3

2) execute "compile_ifort_par.csh"
     or
   configure FC=ifort MPI=$MPI_TOP NETCDF_ROOT=$NETCDF_ROOT --enable-openmp --prefix=$CODE
   make

3) executable main_analog is under directory code


----------------------------------------------
COMPILATION STEPS ON LINUX CLUSTER: ifort only
----------------------------------------------

This is the same as ifort with OpenMPI except that MPI path is not needed.

Use "compile_ifort_seq.csh" in directory "anen".

executable main_analog is under directory code


--------------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION STEPS ON LINUX CLUSTER: gfortran and OpenMPI
--------------------------------------------------------

The use of IEEE libraries requires GNU fortran 5.1 or higher.

You need Netcdf and OpenMPI compiled with GNU C and Fortran.

Do the following (paths may be different on your machine)

   setenv CODE $PATH/anen

   setenv NETCDF_ROOT /glade/apps/opt/netcdf/4.3.3.1/gnu/5.1.0

   setenv MPI_TOP /glade/u/home/chengw/gnu/mpich

   configure FC=gfortran MPI=$MPI_TOP NETCDF_ROOT=$NETCDF_ROOT --enable-openmp --prefix=$CODE

   make


-------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION STEPS ON LINUX CLUSTER: gfortran only
-------------------------------------------------

Everything is the same as gfortran and OpenMPI compilation as in the above
but without the MPI environment. Do the following

   configure FC=gfortran NETCDF_ROOT=$NETCDF_ROOT --prefix=$CODE

   make

-------------
Special notes
-------------

- To add new compilation options/flags or to modifying existing ones, you need to modify 
configure.ac . Then,

1) after modifying configure.ac, type "autoreconf"

2) after running "configure", to use MPI, edit file
"configure" and add "$MPI/bin" before each "mpif90"
before typing make

- Options to compile: 

gfortran (must have 5.1 or higher) and Intel Fortran.
Both gfortran and ifort work with OpenMPI or MPI. 
PGI fortran is not working yet. Actually, you need to use pgf95. 
There are many locations where arrays need to be allocated explicitly 
for pgf95  to work. Additionally, the subroutine lib/permute.f90
needs to be modified as follows:

        integer,  intent (in ) :: order(:)

                to

        integer,  intent (in ) :: order(3)

and for lib/permute_4d.f90,

        integer,  intent (in ) :: order(:)
        
                to
        
        integer,  intent (in ) :: order(4)
